## Problem Summary
The purpose of this project is to implement deep learning concepts and 
techniques on a real dataset: UIUC GPA. The general questions that will require the 
application of deep learning is predicting the GPA/grade distribution of UIUC 
courses in the future. The project will provide some visualization of the data and 
descriptive statistics, implement linear or logistic regression, and recurrent neural 
networks.
